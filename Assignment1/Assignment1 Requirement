Assignment 1: Relational Database SQL


———Goal: 

Create relations to store data

normalize relations 
employ foreign key constraints on necessary columns
load data into relations

perform queries to answer questions

——-Deliverables:

describe the schemas of your relations(CREATE statements)
explain your data import strategy (python library/csv importer/shell command/etc)
queries / answers to my questions (answer first query after)

 Remember you may not need all the columns so you may choose to build a model that will be the minimal to answer the questions. 

Automation is always the goal. 

There is a deadline ;)
