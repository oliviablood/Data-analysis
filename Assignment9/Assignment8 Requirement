Assignment9: unsupervised learning

For the following two data sets, originating from the Irvine Machine Learning Repository (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/):

Iris (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris)
Congressional Voting Records (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Congressional+Voting+Records)

Build clustering models the result based on each of these algorithms:
K-means (Bonus if initializing with K-means++)
Gaussian Mixture Model
Hierarchical Clustering

Note: You also need to demonstrate how to determine the number of clusters based on one of these methods: 
elbow, BIC, or Silhouette

Visualize both datasets based on each of these algorithms:
PCA
Autoencoder (t-sne)
